Online Tiffin Service System (OTSS) is an established concept which is used to 
manage online Tiffin services lifecycle through various technologies and process oriented tools. 
This study identifies how web application can be utilized to provide food services to the customers 
and to understand the potential of web application in the business environment.


Online Tiffin Service System is a web based application which allows the administrator to handle 
all the activities online quickly and safely. Using Interactive GUI anyone can quickly learn touse 
the complete system. This system will give power and flexibility to administrator to manage the 
entire system from a single online portal.


In Online Tiffin Service System we use PHP and MySQL Database. This project keeps the records 
of Tiffin orders. This project has two module i.e. admin and user.


The aim of doing this project is to have practical knowledge of Tiffin service’s team and their 
actual performance in the supply and management of food delivery service. 


Now a day’s readymade food is easily available but homemade food and its taste is a different 
matter. In our busy schedule fresh and homemade food preparation is difficult in early mornings. 
But it is made possible by Tiffin service carry homemade food and deliver the same before our 
lunch time.


This web application allows food seekers to directly order a Tiffin for their afternoon lunch online. 
This application is built to be beneficial to student knowledge as well as help Tiffin service 
provider.
