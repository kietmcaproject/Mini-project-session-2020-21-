Security is the first thing that comes to our mind before using it. In day-to-day life, 
we have a lot of different accounts on different platforms. And the challenging task is to 
remember all the passwords. 

That is the biggest problem in today's digital world for 
everyone. So it is required to make a solution for it. Solution: For this problem, we have to 
decide to make an application which is meet the requirement of what we need. After all the 
research we decided to make an application (Privlok) which stored all the credential 
information in encrypted form for security purpose through which the new user make there 
an account on privlok and existing user can directly log in. 


Users can store their passwords with their account handle. User information will store in encrypted form. Our project is 
based on android technology. The technology which we are using in our application is as 
follows .i.e., Android Studio and SQLite. The benefit of our application in the real world is that 
users do need to remember all the passwords all the time. Users can access their data 
whenever is required.
